# Hello Hacker 
This was the first module that gave an introduction to the command line interface in two challenges which were fairly simple and direct.
## Intro to Commands
In this level of the challenge the task was to invoke our first command. I was asked to invoke the 'hello' command to get a flag. When I clicked start I was given a choice to
interact with it either using VScode Workspace or GUI Desktop Workspace. I chose VScode Workspace since I was comfortable using VScode terminal previously.
I then proceeded to open the terminal and invoked the 'hello' command as instructed by the challenge. Upon which I recieved my flag which I copy-pasted and submitted that was
deemed correct. I also learned that commands are case sensitive.

## Intro to arguments
In this level of the challenge the task was to invoke a command along with an argument. It is observed that the shell interprets the first word of our input as the command 
and the subsequent words as arguments. One such example is the 'echo' command, which basically prints the arguments entered by the user back out onto the terminal.
However in the challenge we were asked to use 'hello' as our command and 'hackers' as our arguments. So upon opening the terminal (on VScode Workspace) after starting
I entered my first word to be 'hello' which would be interpreted as a command and then entered 'hackers' as the argument. This was correct and I got my flag which I copy-
pasted and submitted.
